## Something I learned:
 - In game development, a fun and also a hard part is how to translate the rules into algorithm that computer can understand. For example, in tic-tac-toe, a winner is the player whose marks get in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally). In the code, we give each square a unique number, and put all possible win route into a array, and compare it with user's move, which is also saved in a array.
 - Immutability is a key part in ReactJS.
